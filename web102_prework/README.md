## Notes

Some challenges encountered during the project included:
- Understanding how to use `reduce()` for real-time statistics.
- Dynamically filtering and re-rendering DOM elements while keeping the UI clean.
- Making sure event listeners didnâ€™t pile up duplicate cards (thank you `deleteChildElements()` ðŸ’¡).
- Getting the GIF size and embed path correct for GitHub display.
